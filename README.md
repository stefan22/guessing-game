## About

A short game where a user tries to guess a random generated five letter word
by the computer.  
At load, it shows the game instructions and asks user to guess word.  
Once user submits a word (at least 3 characters long), a table appears
below the text input box section showing the number of matching letters against
the computer's word or a message indicating that you have guessed it correctly.  
Fetching word GET/req <repo>`[game-server-repo] http://localhost:[process.env.PORT || 3000]/word`
